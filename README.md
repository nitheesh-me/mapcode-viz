# Mapcode Visualization

Mapcode Visualization is a project aimed at modeling recursion and algorithms using the `mapcode` framework. This repository contains Typst documents that demonstrate various algorithms and their implementations in a structured and visually appealing manner.

## Features (TODO: Update as per latest changes)
- **Algorithm Implementations**: Includes examples like factorial, Fibonacci, binomial coefficients, and longest common subsequence.
- **LeetCode Problems**: Solutions to selected problems, such as "Add Two Numbers."
- **Typst Framework**: Utilizes Typst for document generation and visualization.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated workflows for building and releasing Typst documents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Typst](https://typst.app/) installed on your system.
- A Linux-based environment (recommended).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nitheesh-me/mapcode-viz.git
   cd mapcode-viz
   ```
2. Install Typst if not already installed.

### Usage
To build the Typst document:
```bash
typst compile main.typ
```

or use the [VSCode extension for Typst](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) to compile/preview directly from the editor.

The output will be a PDF file named `main.pdf`.
